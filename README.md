# KoineGreekCheatSheet
A simple Koine Greek Cheat Sheet written in HTML. This is a work in progress. I am attempting to not only include the Koine Greek Alphabet but include quick links to helpful resources such as the Perseus Digital Library to assist with study and research. Hopefully, you will see vast improvements of the older screenshot over time.
